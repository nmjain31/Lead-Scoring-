Problem Statement
An education company called X education which sells online courses to industry professionals is suffering from poor conversion rates to their courses. 
So, they want us to build a model which helps them identify their most potential leads ('Hot leads'), 
so that they can be targeted easily by the Sales team to increase their conversion rate.

Herein, while building the model, we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that 
the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. 
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

Business Goal and Objectives
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads
which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold 
and will mostly not get converted.

There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future 
so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. 
Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
